BACKGROUND ESTIMATION
This script creates the Pdfs for the background contributions and extract the alpha function for the W+jets background.

use CMSSW_5_3_32 (needs ROOT 5.32)
clone the repository with
    git clone https://github.com/undeo/aTGC2017-Background.git
run the script with
    python prepare_bkg_oneCat.py -b --channel el --readtrees
        -b:             batch mode
        -c:             channel (el or mu)
        --readtrees:    read the TTrees and save to RooDataHists (only needed once per channel)

plots are saved in      plots_{channel}_HPV_900_3500
workspace is saved in   cards_{channel}_HPV_900_3500 (wwlvj_{channel}_HPV_workspace.root)
the workspace has to be copied to the Input folder in the directory of the signal estimation script

new PDFs can be added in PDFs/HWWLVJRooPdfs.cxx, which has to be compiled in ROOT using (in this order)
    .L PdfsDiagonalizer.cc+
    .L Util.cxx+
    .L hyperg_2F1.c+
    .L HWWLVJRooPdfs.cxx+
